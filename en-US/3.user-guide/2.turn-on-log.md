# Enable the logging feature

OceanBase Connector/ODBC supports logging. This topic describes how to enable logging in Linux and Windows systems. 

OceanBase Connector/ODBC supports limiting the size of log files. When a log file exceeds 100 MB, a large log file is split into multiple small files with each file not exceeding 100 MB. 

## Enable logging in Linux

You can add `OPTION=4` to the `odbc.ini` configuration file to enable logging. Logs are stored in the `/tmp/obodbc.log` directory by default. 

You can also run the command below to enable logging. (This command has a higher priority than the setting in `odbc.ini`. If there is no setting in the file, the setting in the driver manager will be used.) 

```sql
export ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=true
```

After enabling logging, run the following command to set the log path: 

```sql
export ODBC_LOG_DIR=/home
```

Then, add the following information to `odbcinst.ini` to configure data source name (DSN) logging: 

```sql
[ODBC]
Trace=YES
TraceFile=/odbc.log
```

## Enable logging in Windows

When you add a DSN on the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** page, select the **Debug** check box in the **Cursor/Results** area to enable logging. The `obodbc.log` file is stored in the temporary directory by default.

You can also set the `ODBC_LOG_ENABLE` environment variable to enable or disable logging. (This environment variable has a higher priority than the setting in the driver manager. If it is not specified, the setting in the driver manager will be used.) 

```sql
ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=true
ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=false
```

After you enable logging by setting the environment variable, set `ODBC_LOG_DIR` to specify the log path. 

```sql
ODBC_LOG_DIR=/home
```

Then, configure DSN logging, start tracing, and set the log file path on the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** page.
