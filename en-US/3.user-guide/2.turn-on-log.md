# Enable logging

OceanBase Connector/ODBC supports logging. This topic describes how to enable logging in Windows and Linux. 

## Enable logging in Linux

You can add the `OPTION=4` setting to the `odbc.ini` configuration file to enable logging. Logs are stored in the `/tmp/obodbc.log` directory by default.
You can also run the following commands to respectively enable and disable logging. The commands are prior to the setting in the `odbc.ini` configuration file. If you do not run the following commands, the setting in the driver manager is used. 

```sql
export ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=true
export ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=false
```

After logging is enabled, run the following command to set a log path. 

```sql
export ODBC_LOG_DIR=/home
```

Then add the following information to the `odbcinst.ini` configuration file for data source name (DSN) logging. 

```sql
[ODBC]
Trace=YES
TraceFile=/odbc.log
```

## Enable logging in Windows

When you add a DSN on the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** page, select Debug in the **Cursor/Results** section to enable logging. The `obodbc.log` file is stored in a temporary directory by default.

You can also set the `ODBC_LOG_ENABLE` environment variable to enable or disable logging. This environment variable is prior to the setting in the driver manager. If it is not specified, the setting in the driver manager is used. 

```sql
ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=true
ODBC_LOG_ENABLE=false
```

After you enable logging by setting the environment variable, set `ODBC_LOG_DIR` to specify a log path. 

```sql
ODBC_LOG_DIR=/home
```

Then configure DSN logging, enable tracing, and set a file path on the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** page.
