# Overview

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is developed to share data between heterogeneous databases. It has become a main component of the Windows Open System Architecture (WOSA) and a standard for database access interfaces in Windows. ODBC provides a unified interface for accessing heterogeneous databases. It allows applications to access data managed by different database management systems (DBMSs) based on SQL. Therefore, applications can directly manipulate data in databases regardless of the database design. ODBC allows you to access database files on all types of computers and non-database objects such as Excel and ASCII files.
OceanBase Connector/ODBC is developed based on the MySQL ODBC driver. It allows you to use new data models, such as arrays, provided by OceanBase Database. The following figure shows the architecture of OceanBase Connector/ODBC.

## Application

An application accesses data on an OBServer through a standard ODBC API. Then the ODBC API communicates with the driver manager. To access data, the application only needs to know the data source name (DSN), without knowing where or how the data is stored or how the system is configured. 

The following tasks are universal for any applications that use ODBC:

* Select and connect to an OBServer. 
* Submit SQL statements for execution. 
* Search for execution results, if any. 
* Handle errors. 
* Commit or roll back transactions that contain the SQL statements. 
* Disconnect from the OBServer. 

Most data access operations are performed through SQL statements. Therefore, applications that use OceanBase Connector/ODBC mainly need to submit SQL statements and search for execution results of the statements. 

## Driver manager

The driver manager is a library that manages communication between applications and drivers. It performs the following tasks:

* Parse the DSN used to connect to the database. Database connection information is identified by the DSN. The DSN is a configuration string that identifies a database driver, a database, a database host, and optional identity authentication information. Any applications compatible with ODBC can use the same preconfigured DSN to connect to the data source. 
* Load and unload the driver required for accessing the database defined in the DSN. For example, if you configured a DSN for connecting to an OceanBase database, the driver manager loads OceanBase Connector/ODBC to enable the ODBC API to communicate with OBServers. 
* Handle ODBC function calls or pass them to drivers. 

## OceanBase Connector/ODBC

OceanBase Connector/ODBC is a library used to implement the functions supported by the ODBC API. It is used to handle ODBC function calls, submit SQL requests to OBServers, and return results to applications. It allows you to modify the requests from applications to make them comply with the syntax specifications of OceanBase Database. 

## ODBC.INI

The ODBC.INI configuration file stores the driver and database information required for connecting to an OBServer. Based on the DSN defined in the ODBC.INI configuration file, the driver manager can determine the driver to be loaded, and the driver can read connection parameters. 

## OBServer

An OBServer is the server of an OceanBase database. Query operations can fetch data from the database, and insert and update operations can act on data in the database.
