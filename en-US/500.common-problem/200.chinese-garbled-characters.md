# Chinese garbled characters

## Chinese garbled characters are generated when I use a Windows-based client to call OceanBase Connector/ODBC to query data and use GBK as the default character set of my system. What should I do? 

The cause is that if you do not specify a character set when you establish a connection by using OceanBase Connector/ODBC, the default system character set UTF8 is used.
`MARIADB_CHARSET_INFO *cs= mariadb_get_charset_by_name("auto");`

If your system uses UTF8, you can query data normally. If your system uses GBK, UTF8-encoded data cannot be displayed.
To solve this problem, add code to specify the character set of the data to be read after you establish a connection. Example:

```sql
/*Specify the character set.*/
MDBUG_C_PRINT(Connection, "--cs_name:%s", Connection->Charset.cs_info->csname);
if (mysql_set_character_set(Connection->mariadb, Connection->Charset.cs_info->csname))
goto err;
```
