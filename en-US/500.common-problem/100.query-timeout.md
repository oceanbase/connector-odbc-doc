# Query timeout

## What should I do if the connection time exceeds 20 seconds and a server disconnection error is returned when executing the `SELECT SLEEP(21) FROM DUAL` statement? 

Set the `READTIMEOUT` parameter in the `odbc.ini` configuration file, which triggers the closing of the socket by a socket read timeout and allows the client to actively disconnect from the server to avoid long-time blocking of the client. 

```sql
# Configure the odbc.ini configuration file
[OBDSN]
Driver     = OBDRIVER
Description = OceanBase Driver DSN
SERVER      = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (Database IP address)
PORT        = 38884 (Actual database port number)
USER        = tester@oracle (Username for logging in to the database)
Password    = 1****** (Password for logging in to the database)
Database    = oceanbase (Database name)
OPTION      = 4
charset  = UTF8 (Database character set)
READTIMEOUT= 20
```

Note that if `READTIMEOUT`=20 and `ob_query_timeout`=10000000 (10s), executing `SELECT SLEEP(15) FROM DUAL` will return a `TIMEOUT` error. This approach is achieved by setting `ob_query_timeout`, which causes the server to actively report an error to the client if the execution time exceeds the specified time, thereby avoiding long-time blocking of the client.
